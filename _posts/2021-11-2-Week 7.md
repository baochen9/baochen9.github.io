The hansard website can not only provide research materials for researchers engaged in the study of British history and the history of changes in the British Parliament, but also serve as an important resource for politicians who need to make decisions or proposals in Parliament.
For those politicians, they can find supportive views and historical backgrounds on this website, and at the same time find their own expressions in past debates and unified opinions, which will be more conducive to the adoption of the policies they want to implement.
The website can provide relevant personnel who study British history with the policies or debates made by the British Parliament at each important time point.  Many of these debates or unanimous opinions have an important influence on historical changes.  In addition, for researchers focusing on the development of the British Parliament, the website provides relevant content of different historical periods and different members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, which greatly enriches the materials needed for their research.

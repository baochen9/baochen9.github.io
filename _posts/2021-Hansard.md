A website for the official report of all Parliamentary debates. Find Members, their contributions, debates, petitions and divisions from published Hansard reports dating back over 200 years. Daily debates from Hansard are published on this website the next working day.

The Hansard can not only provide research materials for researchers engaged in the study of British history and the history of changes in the British Parliament, but also serve as an important resource for politicians who need to make decisions or proposals in Parliament.

The Hansard can provide relevant personnel who study British history with the policies or debates made by the British Parliament at each important time point.  Many of these debates or agreements have an important influence on historical changes.  In addition, for researchers focusing on the development of the British Parliament, the Hansard provides relevant content of different historical periods and different members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, which greatly enriches the materials needed for their research.
For those politicians, they can find supporting views and historical background on Hansard, and at the same time, they can find their own expressions in past debates and agreements, so as to facilitate the adoption of the policies they want to implement.
